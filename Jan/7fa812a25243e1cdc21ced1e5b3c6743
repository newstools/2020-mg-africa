I’m going to Stellenbosch University to pursue a Bachelor of Science degree in molecular biology and biotechnology. I want to learn about microorganisms. I grew up on a farm in Augrabies, in the Northern Cape, where my parents are table grape farmers. I am the middle child of three sisters and I lived there most of my life, but then I went to Paarl —to Paarl Gimnasium High School —to study. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div> On top of my main seven subjects, I added German second additional language and visual arts. I got nine distinctions out of nine subjects I wrote. My winning trick has been excelling since I was in grade 8, and [achieving] consistency throughout the years. I don’t believe there was any recipe to passing my matric. I would advise matriculants to start working hard from the beginning of the year: that’s the only way to win. In 2018 I was one of two South African pupils who were selected to go to the United States space agency. While there, I got an opportunity to interact with other people who are passionate about science. The experience taught me so much about research. I was so shocked when I received the news that I am the top achiever in the country. I was not expecting it in any way. My parents will be paying for my tuition fees in the meantime. I have not received any offers and I didn’t apply for any bursaries. — Madelein Dippenaar, 18, as told to Chris Gilili
