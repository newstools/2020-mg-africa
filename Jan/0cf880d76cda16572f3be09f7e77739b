Sibabalwe Mkunqwana’s mother, Zoleka, says that as far back as 2010, her daughter predicted that she would be one of the top achievers in matric. She would even tell her mother what dress she should wear to the awards ceremony. Zoleka says that last year, when they were watching the announcement of the matric results, her daughter said again: “Mama, ndizovela eTV nam [Mama, I am also going to be on TV].” When the call came through inviting Sibabalwe to attend the matric results announcement this week, as one of the top 30 achievers flown in from across the country, Zoleka says her daughter said: “I told you that I was going to be on TV.” Zoleka spoke to the Mail & Guardian this week at Vodaworld in Midrand, north of Johannesburg, during a ministerial breakfast organised for the top achievers in the 2019 matric results.
