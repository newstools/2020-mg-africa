Onderstepoort Biological Products (OBP), a state-owned animal vaccine manufacturer, faces allegations of capture after its board appointed a chief executive without him undergoing security vetting. Baptiste Dungu had previously worked at OBP but had resigned in 2008 while being investigated for allegedly selling intellectual property and bacteria strains to private companies around the world. Dungu’s appointment in March last year also did not follow the correct employment procedures; it did not have the approval of the Cabinet and company’s shareholder representative, the minister of agriculture. The OBP produces bacterial, viral and blood vaccines for animals. These are sold to local and international markets. This article is only available to Mail & Guardian subscribers at present.
